# Assignment3

This is the repo for ETC5513 Assignment 3 due on May 22 at 5:00pm.

# The Goals of the assignment:

- Demonstrate that you are capable to create a **group** reproducible **pdf** report using Rstudio, Git and GitHub using all the tools that we have learnt.
- Confirm that you are able to clone a repository locally and synchronise the changes to the remote GitHub repo.
- Confirm that you can create meaningful commits so that the changes and the history of the project can be tracked.
- Show that you can create and merge branches as well as resolve conflicts.
- Please use the template provided in this repo. For this assignment you do **not** need to modify the template. Also make sure that all the R code and R messages do not appear in the report.


# Tasks 

In groups of three (same groups as in Tutorial 8) create a reproducible and collaborative report to answer the following question:

**Select two countries from the data set and explain how does the corona virus affect the countries that you have selected?** 

- Make sure that inside your section you have a figure and a table that both are referenced in the text. In addition, add a paper/book reference into the text too and update the bib file with the reference. Write a paragraph with no more than 100-150 words to discuss your answer to the research question refering to your figure and your table.
- To help you with your data wrangling and figures have a look at week's 8 lecture demo template. 

# Logistics
- In your groups please nominate a person who will access the repository in this link (https://classroom.github.com/g/sIoNpzKN) and create the group in GitHub classroom. Then the other members of the team please join the same group. The repo can be public or private. 
- Once all the members of your team have joined the group in GitHub classrooms you can all start working in the project.
- Each team member should then clone the repository in your local machine and create a branch to work in your own section. Please name the branch using your name and surname (**name_surname**).
- Each member of the group will work in one section (if you are 4 in your team please create a new section in the report.Rmd file).
- Make sure that you stage, commit and push the changes that you are making into your own branch as you are creating your section (don't leave it all to the end).
- While you work in your section please make sure you work in your branch and  commit and push changes into your **own branch** in the remote repository too. That will minimize conflicts.
- Also make sure you fetch the contents of the remote repository from time to time (don't leave that to the end).
- Once your section is complete then please merge your branch into your repo and deal with any possible conflicts. 
- It might be helpful to set up a zoom meeting with your team members once you are ready to merge your branch into the master branch to create the final report. One of the members at a time can merge their branch with the master while sharing screen with the others. Like that you can help each other fixing conflicts and that will ensure that you are not merging different branches at the same time which might cause more complicated merging conflicts.


# Due date

- Assignment is due on Friday May 22 at 5pm. Late submissions will not be accepted.
- By the due date all the changes in your repo needs to be merged to the master branch.
- If GitHub repos are modified after the submission date. The assignment will be marked with a 0.
- GitHub repos that are not reproducible will be marked with a 0.
 
 # Assignment submission 

- In Moodle: paste the http of your GitHub repo (**submissions that do not contain this information to reproduce the report will be considered non-reproducible **). Make sure that all your paths are relative to the project folder.
- Upload the Rmd file of the project.
- Upload the pdf file of the project.
- Important:
    - Your GitHub repo including all the history will be also marked. 
    - Donâ€™t worry if you encountered problems during the commits, branching or merging. The important thing is that all the conflicts are resolved and you have your final report in the last commit of your master branch. That will show that you are capable to use the tools!
    - **All the files** used to create the report needs to be included in the GitHub repository. **If the report cannot be reproduced from the clone repository the assignment will be considered not reproducible and will be marked with a 0**.
